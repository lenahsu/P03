                            <h4>Research</h4>
                            <p>We chose the domain of urban farming/agriculture which can be defined as the practice of cultivating, processing and subsequently distributing food in, or around a village, town, or city.</p>
                            <p>Much of our research showed that teacher's limitations in agriculture literacy can prevent student engagement.</p>
                            <p>This led to our pitch: an <strong>educational application</strong> assisting teachers and students in learning and <strong>tracking gardening progress</strong>, developing food preparation skills and managing school garden sales.</p>
                            <p>We began to conduct research on the impact of student learning and skill development through a digital medium in hopes of fostering <strong>sustainabile values in children</strong>at a young age.</p>

                                <p>2. What is school gardening and how do you see it as a positive for students?</p>

                                <p>1. Present the prototype's concept: providing teachers with a tool to assist in gardening activities and learning.</p>
                                <p>2. Participant interacts with the prototype</p>
                                <p>3. Interviews participant on her understanding of the prototype and how well it may integrate into the existing curriculum.</p>

                            <p>We ran the test once in an empty classroom after the school day had ended out of consideration for the participant's schedule as well as the school's visor policy.</p>

                            <p>The following design issues were raised during our user testing:</p>
                            <div class="flex-grid-two">
                                <div class="col">

                                <div class="col">
                                    <p>1. The Feature of adding students into 'My Classroom' process was impractical and not necessary with a class of thirty.</p>
                                    <p>The user stated that in an elementary school garden, the feature will most likely be left aside since it is a bit tedious.</p>

                                    <p>2. Choice of wording and copywrite led to a lot of confusion.</p>
                                    <p>When onboarding, the categories 'My Classroom' and 'My Garden' were misleading. Another issue we had was the label of the search bar as 'Plants' and the use of our 'filters' when searching for these plants.</p>

                                    <p>Most of the time, the participant had to read the smaller print to know to tap on the animations or did not know to tap on them at alwl resulting in the participant skipping over sections.</p>

                            <h4>Moving Forward</h4>
                            <p>Moving forward in the design iterations, we removed the teaching portion and the student management. Cultivate featured a more detailed garden creation user interface witha more intuitive crop selection tool that will suggest suitable crops to grow alongside each other in a trough. In order to implement Cultivate into a curriculum, a French version will be important for Canadian schools.</p>
                            <p>The user testing gave us a lot of insights into what teachers required when school gardening. Working within the scope of the project, we limited ourselves to only a few features. OVerall, with our app, we wanted to promote a susttainable future starting with our youths.</p>
