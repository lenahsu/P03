                                <p>I took this course during my exchange semester. What was unique about this project was that I got to experience different approaches and methods in interaction design while immersing myself in Swedish culture. Malmö University has given me the opportunity to freely explore and build on my foundation at my home university while offering a different perspective. My exchange semester has given me the opportunity to reflect on the connections I make around me and the impact of good design on different communities.</p>

                                <p>From the research compiled, it was evident that there was value in using music as a tool to learn something else as it can be integrated in all curricular areas to enhance creativity.</p>

                                <p>Much learning occurs without conscious awareness, suggesting that the user's secondary focus can be elsewhere while simultaneously interacting with music.</p>

                                <p>There is also alot of supporting evidence that tangible user interfaces can empower artsits, boost their creative expression, and enhance performing art.</p>

                                <p>“When asked how they learned and remembered the words so quickly, one very musically talented person replied, ‘Easy, put anything to music and I can remember it.’”</p>
                                <p>“Extensive active engagement with music can induce cortical reorganization. This may produce functional changes in how the brain processes information.”

                                    <p>The participants had a need to physically relate to the boards and suggested landscapes with fishes and oceans instead.

                                <p>Moving forward from Pompom, a second layer interaction and a customizable feature would be required. To challenge the interaction and increase engagement, we would add more boards and combos where users can create new sounds and new animations with uploadable shareable content.</p>

                                <p>I had a lot of fun building Pompom with my team while fully delving into tangible and embodied interaction design. With them, I gained a lot of different insights into Malmö University's approaches on concept development, user research, and prototyping. We worked closely everyday for five weeks together and built off of one another's ideas. Our finish product resulted in a working prototype and a detailed paper on our extensive research, product, process, and further considerations.</p>
